# This is GymTrack

GymTrack was created for my Computer Science internal assesment as a solution to my local gym-goers!!

GymTrack is created in Ruby on Rails 7 using Hotwire and Stimulus.js

Gymtrack highlighted the want for simplicity and so the app works completely for
- The logging of Exercises, sets, reps and weights.
- The ability to create and manage personalized workout routines.
