# GymTrack

GymTrack was created for my Computer Science internal assesment as a solution to my local gym-goers!!

GymTrack is a web application built with Ruby on Rails 7, Hotwire, and Stimulus.js. It allows users to track their workouts, exercises, and sets efficiently. The application supports user authentication, workout management, and exercise tracking.

Gymtrack highlighted the want for simplicity and so the app works completely for
- User authentication with Devise
- Create, read, update, and delete workouts
- Add exercises to workouts
- Track sets for each exercise
- Mark workouts as favorites
- Clone existing workouts
- Turbo Streams for real-time updates
- Tailwind CSS for styling
